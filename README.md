# Minimax Tree project - Part 1

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence for the two-player zero-sum game. This project helps you understand how the algorithm works by:
- Playing an interactive tile capture game
- Visualizing the minimax decision tree in real-time
- Observing how game states change with each move
- Understanding the step-by-step evaluation process

## Get Started
### Step 1: Play the game
Start by exploring the tile capture game in **'main.py'**
- Familiarize yourself with the game mechanics
- Understand the rules and objectives
- Try different strategies and observe the outcomes

The game rule:
- Two players will take turns to pick a tile on the 5x5 board. They are allowed to choose the tile that is adjacent to their previous tiles.
- Players will occupy the opponents’ tiles if the number of their tiles adjacent to an opponent’s tile is greater than 1 tile.
- Whoever has a greater number of tiles when no more empty tiles are left is the winner.

## Step 2: Explore the Minimax Visualization
Once you understand the game, examine the minimax tree visualization by clicking "->","D" or "space"
- Watch the tree construction process step by step
- Observe how each node represents a game state
- Follow the algorithm's decision-making process
- Notice how the tree evaluates different possible moves

## What you will learn
- Tree Structure: ** How game states form a decision tree
- Step by Step Execution: Watch the algorithm work step by step
- Decison Path: Follow the optimal move selection
