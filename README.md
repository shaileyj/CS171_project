# Minimax Tree project - Part 1

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in game theory and artificial intelligence for two-player zero-sum game. This project helps you understand how the algorithm works by:
- Playing an interactive tile capture game
- Visualizing the minimax decision tree in real-time
- Observing how game states change with each move
- Understanding the step-by-step evaluation process

## Get Started
### Step 1: Play the game
Start by exploring the tile capture game in **'tile-capture-game.py"
- Familiarize yourself with the game mechanics
- Understand the rules and objectives
- Try different strategies and observe the outcomes
